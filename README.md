Random little repo for stuff I put together for my [Elektron devices](https://www.elektron.se/) that may be useful to others.  ...well, when I fill it with more stuff.

There's:

* A PowerShell script I've put together to convert sound library folders into a format more suitable for the device.  I use this to downsample etc. samples for my Digitakt 2, and can be called in dividual directories with different settings.  So I've got the Amiga 'ST' Sample Packs reduced to a suitable quality, to keep the original files how they are, for example.

* A 3D printable stand for either one device, or two in a top/bottom layout.  There's also a VESA mount for attaching the device's PSU to itself for convenience.

* *(there will be)* sounds, etc. made for my Elektron stuff.

Everything here should be mine directly, and I hereby licence as unlicenced - do what you want with anything in here, with or without credit **EXCEPT FOR ANY FILES THAT HAVE THEIR OWN LICENCE FILE**.  I'm not *planning* on restricting anything, but, y'know, just in case...
