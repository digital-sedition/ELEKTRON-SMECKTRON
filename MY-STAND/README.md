# Hello!

3D printable `STL` files, and Fusion 360 `F3D` source file, for a (hopefully useful!) stand for Elektron boxes like the Digitakt and Analog Heat, along with an entirely separate VESA mount that can be used to secure the device's PSUs and trunk cabling.

![Oooh, look at that 3D printer layout configuration.](/MY-STAND/ELEKTRON_STAND_PRINT.jpg)

I'm not a mechanical engineer; I'm a software engineer.  ...are there better designs?  *Sure.*  ...but this is *free*, with source files if wanted/needed.  **Bear in mind these were made in Fusion 360 Personal; I believe that means these files can only be used for personal reasons, not commercial ones.  You're your own person, but I request you don't attempt to sell prints of these in order to avoid falling foul of Autodesk's legal terms, etc.!**

For what it's worth, I personally use this design - and my Elektrons are still upright, healthy, and free of impact damage...!  I use a Bambu P1S 3D printer, and printed mine using PETG.  Oh, and you may notice screw-holes aren't threaded in the design; this is because 3D printers, even the lovely Bambu ones, aren't perfect...

# The Stand

The stand can either be used just as the lower half, or in its dual top/bottom layout (along with the back legs for extra support).  Either way, units can also be attached to each other if you've got a bajillion devices you want to have all in a lovely row...

![Oooh, what a nice CAD model of a stand.](/MY-STAND/ELEKTRON_STAND.jpg)

* If only using the lower half, the following would need printing: `ELEKTRON_STAND_LOWER_L`, `ELEKTRON_STAND_LOWER_R`, and `ELEKTRON_STAND_TABLE`.

* If using the upper half, you'd additionally need to print: `ELEKTRON_STAND_UPPER_L`, `ELEKTRON_STAND_UPPER_R`, another `ELEKTRON_STAND_TABLE`, `ELEKTRON_STAND_BRACE_L`, `ELEKTRON_STAND_BRACE_R`.

* Optionally, there's also `ELEKTRON_STAND_RETAINER` to help keep devices in place, and `ELEKTRON_STAND_BRACE_CONNECTOR` as additional support for the back legs (or to add other things to the stand if wanted).

As you can see in the top image, the side panels are different on each side; both to provide different screw ends, and to have built-in supports for the table/shelf the devices sit on.

I've removed as much material as possible, for strength, reduction of material, *and* air-flow - and **you're looking at about 925g of material to print a full top/bottom layout.**

# The VESA Thing

In addition to the stand, you can also use - or use them entirely separately - the VESA mount I built for my devices (`ELEKTRON_STAND_VESA_BODY`).  The PSUs they use have fairly long power-cords, so I decided to attach them to the device so they were easier to move about and stuff.  I also added two trunking thingies for cabling, with holes for cable ties.

![Oooh, what a nice VESA thingy.](/MY-STAND/ELEKTRON_STAND_VESA.jpg)

As with the stand, I removed as much material as I could for strength, reduction of material, and air-flow - and there are also stand-offs provided (`ELEKTRON_STAND_VESA_SPACER`), which I'd advise, that provide spacing between the device and the 3D printed plastic.  Given the analog units do produce a bit of heat, I'd rather a) not have the plastic warp slowly over time! and b) not reduce the device's breathability!
